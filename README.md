# RegistrationForm-Django
This project made by my friend and I. I designed and made a web from django and my friend designed and made the android app of it. This is just Registration Form (ex: for an event), so the participants only need registration and the admin can view the list of participants via android or desktop.  

For database I use mysql so the first I installed                                                                          sudo apt-get install python-pip python-dev mysql-server libmysqlclient-dev                                                  pip install django mysqlclient
# How do I run this project ?
